## 关于我
I am a artificial intelligence software engineer at Lenovo Shanghai. I received my Master degree in Control Engineering from USST(University of Shanghai for Science and Technology). Most of my experiences lie in AI model deployment and developing middleware to submit AI job. I am broadly interested in NLP and backend technologies, especially systems with some AI/ML flavor.
